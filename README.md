Once inside, users can explores the random list of beers generated through the API, or do their own search by entering a parameter in the search field. This then provides a list of hit results in which the user can explore the profile of each beer individually.

After reading throught the characteristics of the beer, users can then add the specific beer to their own Cellar Collection, where they can keep a list of their favorite beers. Each added beer can be removed at any time.

Users can also interact with each other via the public chat channel, or even have private chats amongst them, by clicking on their picture icon. Users can also filter the online users list based on their location. The purpose of this filter option is that if desired, users could be filtered based on the locations at which brewdogs has a franchise. For the purpose of simplifying, however, the filtering is at the moment done based on origin location of the users.

Direct social network actions, like "adding friends" is not included as a feature on the website, and the reason behind it is that for the purposes of this website having a friends network does not add any value. The main gol of the application is that users explore the different beer offerings that Brewdog provides.
